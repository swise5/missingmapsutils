In 2013 they implemented the new [http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/11.2461/124.9975&layers=H Humanitarian Map Style], a map more adapted to humanitarian actions. This map, hosted by OpenStreetMap - France, is integrated in various online map tools.  The Tasking Manager and the JOSM editor are essential parts of this Activation. As new imagery are available, new jobs are added to the Tasking Manager. It has allowed HOT to coordinate efforts of mappers around the world. Some days there were more then 200 simultaneous mappers registered on the Task Manager and editing mainly with the JOSM editor. Online editors are also used for less intensive mapping.
